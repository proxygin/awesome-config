proxygin's awesome configuration
--------------------------------

This is my [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) configuration. The
filestructure and setup is borrowed from [Vincent Bernat's awesome
config](https://github.com/vincentbernat/awesome-configuration)
but converted from awesome 3.4 to 3.5.

I like directions. The the main diviation from the default keybindings is in
regards to using directional client focus, client swap and screen switch.
Oh. I also use Dvorak as my keybord layout, so any use of 'hjkl' is replaced by
the Dvorak home row.

This is just a quick and dirty github-push. A lot of small things won't work on
your machine. But hopefully I will generalize the setup in the future, making it
easy for you to fork and use.
